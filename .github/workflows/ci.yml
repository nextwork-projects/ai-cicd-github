**Key changes:**

1. **Set up Python first** - You need Python installed before you can run any Python commands
2. **Install dependencies** - This includes pytest and any build tools
3. **Run tests** - Verify everything works before building
4. **Build package** - Only build if tests pass
5. **Upload artifact** - Upload the built package

**Additional note:** You'll also need to make sure the `build` package is installed. Add it to your `requirements.txt`:
```
build
